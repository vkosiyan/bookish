# About The Project
Bookish is a search site for books using the Google Books API. It also uses the NY Times Book API to render their Best Seller Lists, which renders the Google Books information. It uses authorization to access the site through sign up and log in.

![All TV Shows Page](public/images/readme/allshows.png)

This is where every show added to the database is listed. From here you can click into the details of each show and edit if you are the original creater. You can also go in and leave comments for each movie.

![TV Show Detail Page](public/images/readme/showdetailpage.png)

On every show detail page, you can see the title, release year, IMDB Link, and more for that show.

![Add a TV Show that's not listed](public/images/readme/createshow.png)

If there's a movie you want to add to a list or recommend, but it's not listed, you can add it on this page if you are signed in.

![Recommendation List](public/images/readme/reclistadd.png)

You can create a recommendation list for any category. You add a title and a description, and then choose your  movies from a list to add to your recommendation list.

* Add the ability for the user to choose a username and edit if they'd like
* Add the ability to save or bookmark a show to your profile straight from the show page
* Add an API for tv shows and movies so that users do not have to add them manually
* Add the ability to search for a show or movie in a search bar
* Add the ability to sort movies or lists by a category (eg: genre, streaming platforms, mpaaRating)
* Add other media such as books, video games, podcasts to recommend and create lists for
